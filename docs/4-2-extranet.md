#### Internet Threat Awareness

> **Pain Points**

As businesses move to the cloud, traditional hardware firewalls, IDS, IPS, and NDR solutions often cannot follow or have limited functionality, leading to a severe weakening of security visibility. Open-source threat intelligence is often poor quality with high noise, making semi-automated handling impossible.

> **Recommended Deployment**

Deploy nodes in the Internet zone to sense **real threats** from automated worms, competitors, and overseas attackers. It can even detect **0-day attacks** targeting your organization. By integrating with **Threat Intelligence Platforms**, you can stably and accurately **generate private threat intelligence**.

> **Deployment Notes**

1. **White-listing**: This scenario will capture a **massive amount of real attack traffic**. Suggest adding the honeypot IP to your network detection equipment's whitelist to avoid false alarms.
2. **Compliance**: Some industries require reporting internet-facing assets to regulators. Ensure you register the honeypot address if required.
