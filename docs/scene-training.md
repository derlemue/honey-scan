#### Security Awareness Training

> **Pain Points**

In enterprise security, **employee security awareness** cannot be ignored. For attackers, collecting employee emails and sending bulk phishing links or malware costs very little. Compromising just one victim can breach the enterprise defense line.

> **Recommended Deployment**

Use open-source phishing tools combined with **HFish Custom Web Honeypots** to quickly and cheaply build an **Enterprise Security Awareness Training Platform**.

> **Deployment Notes**

1. **White-listing**: This scenario will capture a **massive amount of real attack traffic**. Suggest adding the honeypot IP to your network detection equipment's whitelist to avoid false alarms.
2. **Compliance**: Some industries require reporting internet-facing assets to regulators. Ensure you register the honeypot address if required.
