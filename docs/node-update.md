#### Node Upgrade Failure Types

1. **Bandwidth Issues**: If upgrading multiple nodes simultaneously, ensure the Management Server has sufficient bandwidth (Recommend 1Mbps allocated per node) or upgrade in batches.

2. **Log Check**: If bandwidth is sufficient, check the node logs.
   Location: `logs/client.log` in the installation directory.
